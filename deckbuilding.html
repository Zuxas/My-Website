                    <strong>Mana Curve:</strong>
                    <p>
                        The mana curve refers to the distribution of card costs in your deck. A well-balanced mana curve
                        ensures that you can play cards efficiently at different stages of the game.
                        Aim for a curve that allows you to play cards consistently without getting stuck with high-cost
                        cards early or low-cost cards late in the game.

                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Low-Cost Cards:</strong> Include enough low-cost cards (1-2 mana) to ensure you have
                            plays in the early game. These cards often help you establish an early advantage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mid-Cost Cards:</strong> Ensure a good number of mid-cost cards (3-4 mana) that can
                            help you maintain momentum and control the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>High-Cost Cards:</strong> Limit high-cost cards (5+ mana) to avoid being overwhelmed
                            early on. These should be impactful and game-changing when you can cast them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Mana Base:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A well-constructed mana base is crucial for consistency. The mana base includes your lands and
                        any mana-fixing cards that help you access the colors of mana needed for your spells.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Land Count:</strong> Generally, a deck should have about 24 lands in a 60-card deck.
                            Adjust this number based on the deck's mana curve and color requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Color Fixing:</strong> Use dual lands, fetch lands, and mana rocks to ensure you
                            have access to the right colors. Consider including cards like "Fabled Passage" or
                            "Chromatic Lantern" for better mana fixing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Consistency:</strong> Aim for a balanced land distribution that supports the deckâ€™s
                            color requirements. Avoid having too many or too few lands of a specific color.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Synergy and Combos:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Deck synergy refers to how well the cards work together to achieve a common strategy. Combos
                        involve specific card interactions that create powerful effects.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Card Interactions:</strong> Focus on cards that complement each other. For example,
                            if you use a lot of tokens, include cards that benefit from having many creatures on the
                            battlefield.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Combos:</strong> Identify and incorporate combos that can win you the game or
                            provide significant advantages. Make sure the combos are reliable and easy to execute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Theme and Strategy:</strong> Build around a central theme or strategy, such as
                            aggro, control, or midrange. Ensure that all your cards contribute to this theme.
                        </li>

                </li>
