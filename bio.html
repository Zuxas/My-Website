            <h1>About Zuxas</h1>

            <h2>Personal Background</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Zuxas. I served in the Navy from 2012 to 2018 as a Fire Controlman, working with TAS, MK23,
                SPQ-9B, NATO Seasparrow, and RAM systems. This role developed my strategic and teamwork skills, which I
                now apply to my gaming endeavors.</p>
            <p>I am married to my wonderful wife for over a decade. We have two amazing daughters who bring joy to our
                lives, and a Rednose Pitbull named Rehgar Earthfury, inspired by World of Warcraft.</p>

            <h2>Gaming Journey</h2>
            <p>My passion for gaming began with a focus on strategy and competition, leading me to excel in several
                games.</p>

            <h3>Magic: The Gathering</h3>
            <p>Starting with the "Saviors of Kamigawa" set, I have evolved from a casual player to a competitive force
                in Magic: The Gathering. I have achieved 19 Top 8 finishes at Regional Championship Qualifiers (RCQs)
                and am currently qualified for the next Regional Championship.</p>

            <h3>World of Warcraft</h3>
            <p>Since the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, I have been deeply involved in World of Warcraft, focusing on
                world-first raiding and pushing 3k+ Mythic+ keys consistently since Battle for Azeroth Season 1.</p>

            <h3>Summoners War</h3>
            <p>In Summoners War, I have achieved Gold 1 in Arena and World Arena, and Gold 2 in Guilds. My goal is to
                optimize my teams and excel in competitive battles.</p>

            <h2>Streaming and Community Engagement</h2>
            <p>Join me on <a href="https://twitch.tv/zuxasLOL" target="_blank">Twitch</a> for streams featuring World of
                Warcraft, Summoners War, and Magic: The Gathering. I enjoy sharing my gameplay experiences and engaging
