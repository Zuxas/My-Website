            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Start Competing Locally:</strong>
                    <p>Participate in local tournaments hosted at your game store or community center. These events
                        provide a less competitive environment to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Refine Skills:</strong> Use local tournaments as a testing ground to practice
                            and perfect your strategies. Learn how to adapt and improve your gameplay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Network:</strong> Meet and learn from other players in your community. Building
                            relationships with fellow players can provide valuable insights and support.</li>
                        <li><strong>Understand the Meta:</strong> Get familiar with the local popular strategies and
                            adjust your deck accordingly. This will give you an edge when facing common local
                            strategies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
