                <h2>Major Strategy Archetypes</h2>
                <p>Competitive Magic: The Gathering decks often fall into one of four broad archetypes, each with its
                    own unique approach to winning the game. Understanding these archetypes can help players tailor
                    their strategies and deck-building choices to better suit their play style and competitive
                    environment.</p>

                <h3>Aggro</h3>
                <p>Aggro (short for "aggressive") decks are designed to win the game as quickly as possible by applying
                    relentless pressure on the opponent. They typically feature a high density of low-cost creatures and
                    direct damage spells to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. Key elements of aggro decks
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low-Cost Creatures:</strong> Aggro decks prioritize creatures that can be played early
                        in the game to establish a board presence quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Damage:</strong> Spells that deal damage directly to the opponent or their
                        creatures help to accelerate the win condition and deal with blockers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The goal is to finish the game before the opponent can stabilize or
                        develop their own strategy. Aggro decks often focus on the early game to maintain momentum.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Control</h3>
                <p>Control decks take a more reactive approach, aiming to dominate the game by managing threats and
                    gaining card advantage over time. Their strategy revolves around surviving the early game and
                    establishing a dominant position in the late game. Key elements of control decks include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Counterspells:</strong> Control decks use spells that counter or negate the opponent's
                        spells to prevent them from executing their strategy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Removal:</strong> Effective removal spells are used to deal with threats on the board,
                        including both creatures and enchantments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Card Draw:</strong> Drawing additional cards helps control players find their key spells
                        and maintain a steady flow of resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Finishers:</strong> Once the opponent's threats have been dealt with, control decks use
                        powerful finishers or win conditions to close out the game.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Combo</h3>
                <p>Combo decks focus on assembling specific combinations of cards that create a powerful effect or lead
                    to an instant win. These decks require careful setup and protection to execute their combos
                    successfully. Key elements of combo decks include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combo Pieces:</strong> The deck includes cards that work together to achieve the desired
                        result, whether it's an infinite loop, an instant win, or a massive advantage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Combo decks often include spells or creatures that protect their
                        key combo pieces from disruption by the opponent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Setup Time:</strong> Many combo decks need time to assemble their combo pieces and may
                        require a combination of draw spells and tutors to find the necessary cards.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Midrange</h3>
                <p>Midrange decks aim to balance between early-game aggression and late-game power. They focus on
                    efficient, versatile threats and answers that can adapt to different situations. Key elements of
                    midrange decks include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Threats:</strong> Midrange decks use creatures and spells that offer good
                        value for their cost, often having abilities that are relevant in multiple stages of the game.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> The deck includes a mix of cards that can handle various
                        situations, providing answers to both aggressive and controlling strategies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Card Advantage:</strong> Midrange decks focus on generating card advantage through
                        powerful plays and recursion to outvalue the opponent over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Presence:</strong> Maintaining a strong board presence helps midrange decks to
                        apply pressure and respond to threats effectively.</li>
                </ul>
