            <div class="column">
                <h2>Major Strategy Archetypes</h2>
                <p>Competitive Magic: The Gathering decks often fall into one of four broad archetypes:</p>

                <h3>Aggro</h3>
                <p>Aggro decks aim to win quickly by overwhelming the opponent with fast, aggressive threats. These
                    decks focus on low-cost creatures and direct damage, aiming to end the game before the opponent can
                    establish their game plan.</p>

                <h3>Control</h3>
                <p>Control decks focus on neutralizing threats and gaining control of the game. They rely on
                    counterspells, removal, and card draw to survive the early game, often winning in the late game
                    through card advantage and powerful finishers.</p>

                <h3>Combo</h3>
                <p>Combo decks aim to execute a specific combination of cards that results in an overwhelming advantage
                    or instant win. These decks focus on assembling specific pieces and often require protection or
                    setup time.</p>

                <h3>Midrange</h3>
                <p>Midrange decks seek to outvalue the opponent through efficient, versatile threats and answers. They
                    blend early-game plays with powerful late-game threats and focus on card advantage and board
                    presence.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Column 2: Decks I'm Considering -->
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Decks I'm Considering</h2>
                <p>As I prepare for the upcoming qualifiers, I’m focusing on several key decks. Here’s a closer look at
                    each deck:</p>

                <h3>Boros Aggro/Burn</h3>
                <p>Boros Aggro/Burn is known for its aggressive playstyle and quick wins. It utilizes efficient burn
                    spells and fast creatures to apply pressure early and often. This deck is well-suited for a meta
                    that includes slower, more controlling decks, and can overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize.
                </p>

                <h3>Mono Green Devotion</h3>
                <p>Mono Green Devotion focuses on ramping up mana to cast powerful creatures and spells. It leverages
                    the devotion mechanic to generate significant value from its green mana sources. This deck can be
                    particularly effective against aggressive strategies due to its ability to ramp into large threats
                    and stabilizers.</p>

                <h3>Izzet Phoenix</h3>
                <p>Izzet Phoenix is fast and aggressive, utilizing Arclight Phoenix to generate explosive plays. It
                    remains a popular choice for players favoring quick, high-impact strategies. This deck can be very
                    effective in a meta with a lot of slower, control-oriented decks.</p>

                <h3>Mono White Humans</h3>
                <p>Mono White Humans is a tribal deck that focuses on quick, efficient creatures. It leverages synergies
                    between human creatures and benefits from strong aggressive plays and combat tricks. This deck is
                    effective against slower and midrange strategies, often overwhelming opponents with fast, consistent
                    pressure.</p>

                <h3>5 Color Humans CoCo</h3>
                <p>5 Color Humans CoCo combines the power of the Collected Company with a diverse range of human
                    creatures across all colors. It offers flexibility and powerful board presence, with the ability to
                    cast impactful creatures from any color. This deck aims to leverage its wide color access to
                    outvalue opponents and generate overwhelming board states.</p>
