                <h2>Major Strategy Archetypes</h2>
                <p>Competitive Magic: The Gathering decks often fall into one of four broad archetypes:</p>

                <h3>Aggro</h3>
                <p>Aggro decks aim to win quickly by overwhelming the opponent with fast, aggressive threats. These
                    decks focus on low-cost creatures and direct damage, aiming to end the game before the opponent can
                    establish their game plan.</p>

                <h3>Control</h3>
                <p>Control decks focus on neutralizing threats and gaining control of the game. They rely on
                    counterspells, removal, and card draw to survive the early game, often winning in the late game
                    through card advantage and powerful finishers.</p>

                <h3>Combo</h3>
                <p>Combo decks aim to execute a specific combination of cards that results in an overwhelming advantage
                    or instant win. These decks focus on assembling specific pieces and often require protection or
                    setup time.</p>

                <h3>Midrange</h3>
                <p>Midrange decks seek to outvalue the opponent through efficient, versatile threats and answers. They
                    blend early-game plays with powerful late-game threats and focus on card advantage and board
                    presence.</p>
