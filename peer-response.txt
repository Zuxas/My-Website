  XXXX  -1. Mobile View Issues 
        Problem: On mobile, content is being cut off, and while zooming out makes it readable, it negatively impacts the style.

        -2. Dynamic Meta Percentages 
         Problem: The meta is constantly changing, and static values might quickly become outdated.
            involves scraping and outside of the scope of my skills

	Website Features and Improvements
		Consider adding additional features from the course material:
			Favicon (the icon that appears in the browser tab)
			Google Font for improved typography
			FontAwesome icons for visual elements
			Incorporate a video for enhanced engagement
			Include a contact form (styled with class material, though non-functional)
		Adding more images could enhance the website's visual interest.

	Principles of Graphic Design
		Your current use of proximity, alignment, and repetition is effective.
			Improve contrast to highlight key elements:
				Identify the primary "call to action" on your site.
				Use contrasting colors to make important features stand out.
				For example, make a "Buy" button or key action items more noticeable.

	Responsive Web Design (RWD)
		Adjust flexbox layouts for better responsiveness:
			Change the layout of flex containers from row to column on smaller screens to avoid overly small images.
	
		Optimize image and text size for smaller devices:
			Consider reducing padding on small screens to prevent text from becoming too small.
			Ensure text remains readable and effectively utilizes screen space.

    -I'm on mobile, the first screenshot is the default view: content is cut off
        Second screenshots are after a punch to zoom out. It's readable but looks a little awkward style wise.
    -Probably convenient/cool/useful to have goldfish links on the meta section so you can easily see example decklists
    -The meta is always changing, not sure if goldfish has APIs or something you can use to grab the meta percentages dynamically instead of plopping down a static value.
    -In the decks section, would be nice if cards were clickable. Both in the paragraphs and the decklists.
